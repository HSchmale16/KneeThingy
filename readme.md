# KneeThing Readme #
This is the readme for the knee thing.

This project contains code from the gnublin api, as that projects
documentation said to just include the source code files from that
project to use the api. Included files are `gnublin.cpp` and
`gnublin.h`.` It also contains code by Derek Molloy for running the
accelerometers, under `src/BMA180Accelerometer.cpp` and
`include/BMA180Acceleromter.h`.
